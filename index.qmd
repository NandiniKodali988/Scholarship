## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In crisis zones around the world — from natural disasters to active conflicts — humanitarian workers serve on the front lines of aid delivery. But increasingly, they are also on the front lines of danger.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Escalating Danger: Aid Worker Attacks Since 1997

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year. This timeline reveals a clear trend: attacks on humanitarian workers have surged over the past two decades. From just over 50 reported incidents in the late 1990s, the numbers have climbed dramatically, peaking above 400 in multiple recent years.

<iframe src="../plots/total_affected_over_time.html" width="800" height="500" style="flex: 0 0 auto; border: none;"></iframe>


Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The general trend points to an important shift: operating in conflict zones has become steadily more challenging for humanitarian workers.

## Changing Risk Exposure: Who Gets Targeted?


This bump chart reveals how the burden of violence has shifted across different types of humanitarian agencies from, ranked by their — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped.


<iframe src="../plots/bumpchart_totalaffected_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

At the top of the chart is the **International NGO (INGO) sector**, with a staggering **3,497 aid workers affected** — by far the highest. These organizations often operate across multiple conflict zones and are highly visible on the ground, making them frequent targets.

Following them are **National NGOs (NNGOs)** with **2,055 affected**. While they may not dominate global headlines, NNGOs often work in the most volatile areas, especially in **South Sudan, Syria, and DR Congo** — where local staff face disproportionate risk.

**UN agencies**, though heavily resourced and coordinated, are not immune: **1,775 workers** have been impacted, especially in post-2000 conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were seen as representatives of international political agendas.

**The Red Cross movement** (split into **NRCS and IFRC – 521** and **ICRC – 204**) generally operates under a protection mandate and neutral stance. Their lower totals may reflect more secure access or different operational strategies, but they remain at risk, particularly in civil war zones.

Finally, **‘Other’ organizations**, including faith-based or smaller civil society groups, account for **105 affected workers** — a lower figure, but still significant in the context of under-reported violence in some regions.

These differences aren't just about numbers — they reflect the **geopolitical roles, visibility, and proximity to frontline danger** that define each organization's work. The gap between **INGOs and ICRC**, for instance, says as much about mission type and perception as it does about scale.


## Who is Behind the Violence?

**Understanding the actors behind attacks** on aid workers is crucial to navigating humanitarian access and security.


<iframe src="../plots/piechart_actorgroups.html" width="70%" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

Nearly **half (48.3%)** of all attacks are attributed to **unknown actors**. This ambiguity often arises in fragile or collapsed states, where **accountability is scarce**, and **perpetrators disappear without investigation**. It also reflects a lack of reporting mechanisms in chaotic or high-risk settings.

Among the identified groups, **Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs)** are responsible for **30.9%** of incidents — a sobering statistic. These include groups like the **Taliban in Afghanistan**, **Al-Shabaab in Somalia**, **ISIS in Syria and Iraq**, and various militias in the **Democratic Republic of Congo** or **South Sudan**. These actors often view aid workers as political actors or threats to local control.

**State Actors**, including police, military, or paramilitary forces, account for **13%** of incidents. In some cases, this reflects targeted crackdowns or mistaken identity in politically charged environments. For example, humanitarian staff have been caught in **military operations in Gaza, Ukraine**, and **Myanmar**.

 **Individuals (5.5%)** include cases of **opportunistic crime, revenge attacks**, or personal grievances, often in **urban settings** or low-security regions.

 The smallest group — **Criminal networks (2.3%)** — are often driven by **ransom, looting, or extortion**, particularly in areas where aid trucks and supplies are seen as valuable targets (e.g., Haiti, parts of Latin America).

This breakdown underscores the **political and operational complexity** of humanitarian work. Whether deliberate or opportunistic, these attacks disrupt relief and **undermine trust between communities and responders**.

## Agency Type vs Attack Context

<iframe src="../plots/heatmap_attackcontext_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

This heatmap offers a granular look at how different types of humanitarian agencies are impacted across various attack contexts. A striking pattern emerges: **INGOs (International NGOs)** consistently bear the brunt of violence, representing **32.5% of all ambushes** and **30.7% of individual attacks**. Their expansive reach across volatile regions and frequent field mobility make them particularly exposed to road-based assaults and targeted attacks.

The **United Nations** follows closely, accounting for **17.7% of ambushes** and **13.9% of individual attacks**, with an additional **11.5% of combat/crossfire incidents**. Their prominent presence in conflict-heavy zones like *South Sudan*, *Syria*, and *Afghanistan* likely contributes to their high visibility and vulnerability.

**National NGOs (NNGOs)** face significant exposure in **combat or crossfire scenarios**, where they make up **20.2%** of such incidents. This is a reminder that local staff are often embedded in frontline communities, operating without the same security protocols or diplomatic protections available to international actors.

While **ICRC** and **Red Cross/Red Crescent (NRCS and IFRC)** agencies see fewer incidents overall, their risk is concentrated in **ambushes** and **conflict settings**, reflecting their mandate to work in highly insecure, war-affected areas. For example, **ICRC personnel** have been targeted during medical evacuations and convoy movements, highlighting the need for additional protective measures even when neutrality is a core principle.

Finally, a notable **15.8% of all incidents fall into an "unknown" attack context**, underscoring gaps in field reporting or chaotic operational environments where details are lost or unverified. This limitation not only affects agency response but also hampers global coordination and learning.

Together, these trends emphasize the importance of **context-specific security strategies**. INGOs should prioritize mobility risk mitigation and route intelligence. The UN may benefit from closer coordination with peacekeeping forces and political actors. NNGOs would be well-served by strengthened partnerships and access to shared security resources, especially in rural and post-conflict settings.

## Most Affected Countries

<iframe src="../plots/grp_context_top7/total_affected_7.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>


When it comes to humanitarian risk, not all regions are equal. This visualization highlights the **seven countries with the highest number of aid workers affected**—a combined total that reflects decades of insecurity, protracted conflict, and fragile governance.

At the top of the list is **Afghanistan**, where over **1,350 aid workers** have been killed, injured, or kidnapped since 1997. The prolonged conflict with the Taliban, the presence of multiple insurgent groups, and the volatility following U.S. withdrawal have made it one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarian operations.

**South Sudan** (890) and **Sudan** (667) follow closely, with instability rooted in civil war, intercommunal violence, and contested humanitarian access. In these countries, aid workers often serve as the only lifeline in hard-to-reach regions, making them highly visible—and therefore vulnerable.

**Syria** (608), amid years of civil war, has seen the systematic targeting of aid convoys and medical facilities, with groups like ISIS and even state actors involved in attacks.

**Somalia** (585) and the **Occupied Palestinian Territories** (578) represent two different but equally complex contexts—one dominated by armed insurgency and clan conflict, the other marked by political tension and military operations.

Finally, the **Democratic Republic of Congo** (448) illustrates how decades of overlapping conflicts, weak infrastructure, and local militia activity create a long-term high-risk environment for local and international aid workers alike.

These numbers reflect more than danger—they reveal where humanitarian presence is both most critical and most at risk. Each country demands a **context-specific security strategy**, ranging from negotiated access and community-based security to robust coordination with peacekeeping and local actors.

These tactics reflect the fragmented nature of militias and their targeting of humanitarian mobility routes.

      The impact is most severe on <strong>INGOs (58%)</strong> and <strong>NNGOs (16.5%)</strong>, suggesting the need for convoy protocols and field team extraction readiness.
