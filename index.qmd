## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In crisis zones around the world — from natural disasters to active conflicts — humanitarian workers serve on the front lines of aid delivery. But increasingly, they are also on the front lines of danger.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Escalating Danger: Aid Worker Attacks Since 1997

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year. This timeline reveals a clear trend: attacks on humanitarian workers have surged over the past two decades. From just over 50 reported incidents in the late 1990s, the numbers have climbed dramatically, peaking above 400 in multiple recent years.

<iframe src="plots/total_affected_over_time.html" width="800" height="500" style="flex: 0 0 auto; border: none;"></iframe>


Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The general trend points to an important shift: operating in conflict zones has become steadily more challenging for humanitarian workers.

## Changing Risk Exposure: Who Gets Targeted?


This bump chart reveals how the burden of violence has shifted across different types of humanitarian agencies from, ranked by their — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped.


<iframe src="../plots/bumpchart_totalaffected_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

International NGOs (INGOs) consistently top the chart with 3,497 affected workers, reflecting their widespread presence in high-risk areas. National NGOs (NNGOs) follow with 2,055 affected, often operating in frontline roles with limited protection.

UN agencies, though heavily resourced and coordinated, are not immune: 1,775 workers have been impacted, especially in post-2000 conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were seen as representatives of international political agendas.

The Red Cross movement (split into NRCS and IFRC – 521 and ICRC – 204) generally operates under a protection mandate and neutral stance. Their lower totals may reflect more secure access or different operational strategies, but they remain at risk, particularly in civil war zones.

Finally, ‘Other’ organizations, including faith-based or smaller civil society groups, account for 105 affected workers — a lower figure, but still significant in the context of under-reported violence in some regions.

The data reveals how visibility, operational scope, and perceived affiliations influence risk. The stark gap between INGOs and others isn’t just about size — it reflects how different organizations are positioned in the geopolitical landscape of humanitarian aid.


## Who is Behind the Violence?

Understanding the actors behind attacks on aid workers is crucial to navigating humanitarian access and security.


<iframe src="../plots/piechart_actorgroups.html" width="70%" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

Nearly 48.3% of incidents involve unknown actors, reflecting the chaotic conditions of collapsed states or areas where reporting and accountability are weak.

Non-State Armed Groups are behind 30.9% of attacks — often in places like Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, and DR Congo. Their motivations range from political opposition to territorial control, viewing aid as interference or leverage.

State Actors are responsible for 13% of incidents, often during military operations or in politically sensitive contexts like Gaza and Myanmar.

Individual perpetrators (5.5%) and criminal groups (2.3%) contribute to more opportunistic violence, especially in urban zones or insecure transit corridors.

These patterns highlight the need for tailored security strategies, grounded in local political understanding and real-time threat assessments.


## How Attack Tactics Vary by Perpetrator

Different types of attackers tend to use different methods. This section explores how attack contexts — such as ambushes, raids, or detentions — vary depending on the actor group involved. Understanding these patterns helps tailor security strategies to specific threats on the ground.
