## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers
Humanitarian crises span borders, but so do the dangers faced by the people responding to them.

The interactive world map below provides a **time-lapse visualization of attacks on aid workers** from **1997 to 2025**, across every region where conflict and disaster intersect with humanitarian operations.

Each red bubble represents the **total number of aid workers affected** in a specific country during a given year â€” including those **killed, wounded, or kidnapped**. The **size of the bubble grows** with the severity of impact, while the **animation timeline** helps track how these patterns have shifted over the past three decades.
