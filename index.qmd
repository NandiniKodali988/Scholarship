## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In conflict zones, areas struck by disaster, and communities in crisis, humanitarian workers play a vital role in delivering aid and support. But over time, these workers have increasingly found themselves facing risks on the job — risks that go beyond the challenging conditions they operate in.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.
