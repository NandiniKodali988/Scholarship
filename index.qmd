## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In conflict zones, areas struck by disaster, and communities in crisis, humanitarian workers play a vital role in delivering aid and support. But over time, these workers have increasingly found themselves facing risks on the job — risks that go beyond the challenging conditions they operate in.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Regional Trends Over Time

Over the last three decades, the risks facing humanitarian workers have steadily increased.

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year.

While there are moments of relative calm, the general trend reveals a sobering reality: conflict zones have become increasingly dangerous for those trying to help.

Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

These patterns highlight not only where aid workers are most at risk, but also how global instability directly affects the safety of those on the front lines of relief efforts.

          <p>While there's been a general decline since that peak, the numbers remain consistently high compared to earlier years. This suggests that although international focus may shift, the risks for humanitarians in the region persist, especially in fragile and post-conflict settings.</p>

## Changing Risk Exposure: Who Gets Targeted?


This bump chart reveals how the burden of violence has shifted across different types of humanitarian agencies from, ranked by their — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped.


<iframe src="../plots/bumpchart_totalaffected_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

At the top of the chart is the **International NGO (INGO) sector**, with a staggering **3,497 aid workers affected** — by far the highest. These organizations often operate across multiple conflict zones and are highly visible on the ground, making them frequent targets.

Following them are **National NGOs (NNGOs)** with **2,055 affected**. While they may not dominate global headlines, NNGOs often work in the most volatile areas, especially in **South Sudan, Syria, and DR Congo** — where local staff face disproportionate risk.

**UN agencies**, though heavily resourced and coordinated, are not immune: **1,775 workers** have been impacted, especially in post-2000 conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were seen as representatives of international political agendas.

**The Red Cross movement** (split into **NRCS and IFRC – 521** and **ICRC – 204**) generally operates under a protection mandate and neutral stance. Their lower totals may reflect more secure access or different operational strategies, but they remain at risk, particularly in civil war zones.

Finally, **‘Other’ organizations**, including faith-based or smaller civil society groups, account for **105 affected workers** — a lower figure, but still significant in the context of under-reported violence in some regions.

These differences aren't just about numbers — they reflect the **geopolitical roles, visibility, and proximity to frontline danger** that define each organization's work. The gap between **INGOs and ICRC**, for instance, says as much about mission type and perception as it does about scale.


## Who is Behind the Violence?

**Understanding the actors behind attacks** on aid workers is crucial to navigating humanitarian access and security.


<iframe src="../plots/piechart_actorgroups.html" width="70%" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

Nearly **half (48.3%)** of all attacks are attributed to **unknown actors**. This ambiguity often arises in fragile or collapsed states, where **accountability is scarce**, and **perpetrators disappear without investigation**. It also reflects a lack of reporting mechanisms in chaotic or high-risk settings.

Among the identified groups, **Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs)** are responsible for **30.9%** of incidents — a sobering statistic. These include groups like the **Taliban in Afghanistan**, **Al-Shabaab in Somalia**, **ISIS in Syria and Iraq**, and various militias in the **Democratic Republic of Congo** or **South Sudan**. These actors often view aid workers as political actors or threats to local control.

**State Actors**, including police, military, or paramilitary forces, account for **13%** of incidents. In some cases, this reflects targeted crackdowns or mistaken identity in politically charged environments. For example, humanitarian staff have been caught in **military operations in Gaza, Ukraine**, and **Myanmar**.

 **Individuals (5.5%)** include cases of **opportunistic crime, revenge attacks**, or personal grievances, often in **urban settings** or low-security regions.

 The smallest group — **Criminal networks (2.3%)** — are often driven by **ransom, looting, or extortion**, particularly in areas where aid trucks and supplies are seen as valuable targets (e.g., Haiti, parts of Latin America).

This breakdown underscores the **political and operational complexity** of humanitarian work. Whether deliberate or opportunistic, these attacks disrupt relief and **undermine trust between communities and responders**.

::: {.callout-note appearance="card" icon="bar-chart" title="Agency Vulnerability by Attack Context"}

This heatmap reveals how different types of humanitarian agencies experience violence — and under what conditions.

**INGOs (International NGOs)** are the most affected overall, accounting for nearly **32% of all ambushes** and **30% of individual attacks**. Their wide operational footprint and presence in high-risk zones make them particularly vulnerable when traveling or during field engagement.

The **United Nations** accounts for about **17% of ambushes** and **13% of individual attacks**, with additional risks in **combat/crossfire (14%)**. Their symbolic and political visibility likely plays a role in these patterns, especially in conflict zones such as **South Sudan**, **DRC**, and **Gaza**.

**National NGOs (NNGOs)** are disproportionately affected during **combat/crossfire**, making up over **19%** of such incidents. This highlights their presence in highly insecure environments, often with limited security resources or diplomatic protections.

**The ICRC and Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement** collectively face fewer incidents in absolute terms, but their risks are concentrated in **ambush (ICRC: 3.5%)** and **combat zones** — consistent with their work in conflict and post-conflict areas.

Across all agencies, nearly **18% of attacks** occur under **unknown contexts**. This reflects the limitations of field reporting in unstable environments and points to the need for better documentation and accountability systems.

📌 These patterns call for **tailored security measures**:
- **INGOs** should invest in secure transportation, route variation, and field risk assessments.
- **UN missions** must align deployments with intelligence coordination and conflict monitoring.
- **NNGOs** need scalable training and support, especially for conflict-prone outreach.
