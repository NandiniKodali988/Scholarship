## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In conflict zones, areas struck by disaster, and communities in crisis, humanitarian workers play a vital role in delivering aid and support. But over time, these workers have increasingly found themselves facing risks on the job — risks that go beyond the challenging conditions they operate in.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Regional Trends Over Time

Over the last three decades, the risks facing humanitarian workers have steadily increased.

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year.

While there are moments of relative calm, the general trend reveals a sobering reality: conflict zones have become increasingly dangerous for those trying to help.

Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

These patterns highlight not only where aid workers are most at risk, but also how global instability directly affects the safety of those on the front lines of relief efforts.

          <p>From the early 2000s through the present, incidents have steadily increased — often peaking during civil conflicts and post-election violence in countries like South Sudan, Somalia, and the DR Congo.</p>
          
          <p>Notably, the rise post-2017 coincides with complex, multi-actor conflicts, often involving non-state armed groups operating in unstable political environments. These spikes aren’t isolated; they reflect a persistent pattern of risk for humanitarian workers across the continent.</p>

        <div style="margin-top: 1.2rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #333;">
          <p> Asia’s trajectory reveals a series of sharp increases and dips, with a notable peak in 2013. This spike reflects some of the deadliest periods for aid workers — particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where insecurity and targeted violence were widespread.</p>

          <p>While there's been a general decline since that peak, the numbers remain consistently high compared to earlier years. This suggests that although international focus may shift, the risks for humanitarians in the region persist, especially in fragile and post-conflict settings.</p>

          <p>Europe’s trendline tells a story of relatively low impact — until a striking surge in 2022.</p>

          <p>This sudden spike reflects the repercussions of the war in Ukraine, where the humanitarian landscape rapidly deteriorated. Conflict zones that were once rare in Europe reemerged, and aid operations became increasingly hazardous.</p>

          <p>Before this, Europe had experienced some of the lowest numbers globally, often related to isolated or politically motivated incidents. The post-2022 trend reminds us that even traditionally stable regions can become flashpoints — and that the need for protective mechanisms is universal, not regional.</p>

          <p>The Middle East’s trajectory remained relatively low and stable for nearly two decades — until a surge beginning in 2022.</p>

          <p>This jump mirrors the escalation of armed conflicts in the region, particularly in areas already affected by longstanding humanitarian emergencies. Aid workers in countries such as Syria, Yemen, and Palestine have increasingly found themselves on the frontlines — not just of aid, but of violence itself.</p>

          <p>South America has seen relatively fewer aid worker attacks compared to more conflict-prone regions, but the risk is far from zero.</p>

          <p>The spikes in 2003 and especially in 2020 reflect moments where aid operations intersected with local unrest or organized violence. These incidents, while infrequent, can still have a chilling effect on humanitarian access in vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>As political and environmental volatility increases, continued vigilance is essential — especially in areas where fragile governance or organized crime poses a threat to neutral humanitarian actors.</p>
