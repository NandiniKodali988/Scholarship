## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In crisis zones around the world — from natural disasters to active conflicts — humanitarian workers serve on the front lines of aid delivery. But increasingly, they are also on the front lines of danger.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Escalating Danger: Aid Worker Attacks Since 1997

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year. This timeline reveals a clear trend: attacks on humanitarian workers have surged over the past two decades. From just over 50 reported incidents in the late 1990s, the numbers have climbed dramatically, peaking above 400 in multiple recent years.

<iframe src="plots/total_affected_over_time.html" width="800" height="500" style="flex: 0 0 auto; border: none;"></iframe>


Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The general trend points to an important shift: operating in conflict zones has become steadily more challenging for humanitarian workers.

## Changing Risk Exposure: Who Gets Targeted?


This bump chart reveals how the burden of violence has shifted across different types of humanitarian agencies from, ranked by their — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped.


<iframe src="../plots/bumpchart_totalaffected_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

International NGOs (INGOs) consistently top the chart with 3,497 affected workers, reflecting their widespread presence in high-risk areas. National NGOs (NNGOs) follow with 2,055 affected, often operating in frontline roles with limited protection.

UN agencies, though heavily resourced and coordinated, are not immune: 1,775 workers have been impacted, especially in post-2000 conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were seen as representatives of international political agendas.

The Red Cross movement (split into NRCS and IFRC – 521 and ICRC – 204) generally operates under a protection mandate and neutral stance. Their lower totals may reflect more secure access or different operational strategies, but they remain at risk, particularly in civil war zones.

Finally, ‘Other’ organizations, including faith-based or smaller civil society groups, account for 105 affected workers — a lower figure, but still significant in the context of under-reported violence in some regions.

The data reveals how visibility, operational scope, and perceived affiliations influence risk. The stark gap between INGOs and others isn’t just about size — it reflects how different organizations are positioned in the geopolitical landscape of humanitarian aid.


## Who is Behind the Violence?

Understanding the actors behind attacks on aid workers is crucial to navigating humanitarian access and security.


<iframe src="../plots/piechart_actorgroups.html" width="70%" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

Nearly 48.3% of incidents involve unknown actors, reflecting the chaotic conditions of collapsed states or areas where reporting and accountability are weak.

Non-State Armed Groups are behind 30.9% of attacks — often in places like Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, and DR Congo. Their motivations range from political opposition to territorial control, viewing aid as interference or leverage.

State Actors are responsible for 13% of incidents, often during military operations or in politically sensitive contexts like Gaza and Myanmar.

Individual perpetrators (5.5%) and criminal groups (2.3%) contribute to more opportunistic violence, especially in urban zones or insecure transit corridors.

These patterns highlight the need for tailored security strategies, grounded in local political understanding and real-time threat assessments.


## How Attack Tactics Vary by Perpetrator

Different types of attackers tend to use different methods. This section explores how attack contexts — such as ambushes, raids, or detentions — vary depending on the actor group involved. Understanding these patterns helps tailor security strategies to specific threats on the ground.

## What Risks Do Different Agencies Face?

<iframe src="../plots/heatmap_attackcontext_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

This heatmap reveals distinct threat patterns across humanitarian agency types. INGOs face the highest number of attacks, particularly ambushes and individual assaults—likely due to their wide presence and mobile operations in conflict zones.

UN agencies follow, frequently impacted by ambushes, crossfire, and individual attacks, reflecting their visibility in highly volatile settings like South Sudan and Syria.

NNGOs, embedded in frontline communities, are disproportionately affected by crossfire, often without the protective infrastructure available to international actors.

While ICRC and Red Cross affiliates face fewer incidents overall, their exposure peaks during evacuations and frontline work, especially in ambush scenarios.

Strikingly, nearly 1 in 5 attacks occur in undocumented contexts, highlighting urgent gaps in field reporting that can hamper risk mitigation and future planning.

## Where Aid Work Is Most Dangerous

<iframe src="../plots/grp_context_top7/total_affected_7.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>


This chart shows the seven countries with the highest number of aid workers affected since 1997 — a reflection of long-running conflicts and operational challenges.

Afghanistan leads, with over 1,350 incidents, driven by insurgent activity, political instability, and targeted attacks. South Sudan and Sudan follow, where aid access is often contested amid civil war and intercommunal violence.

Syria, Somalia, and Palestine face continued risks tied to armed groups, military operations, and urban warfare. In the DR Congo, overlapping militia activity and weak infrastructure heighten exposure.

## Conclusions

Violence against humanitarian workers has increased notably since the early 2000s, with spikes aligning with major conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria, and South Sudan. The majority of known attacks are attributed to Non-State Armed Groups, primarily through ambushes, raids, and individual attacks in high-risk zones.

INGOs bear the highest overall burden (3,497 affected), while NNGOs face heightened risks in countries like Syria (53.4%) and Afghanistan (32.8%), often without adequate security infrastructure.

Threat patterns vary by region — State Actors are dominant in Palestine and Syria, while NSAGs lead in Somalia, Sudan, and DR Congo. This variation underscores the need for tailored, context-specific security strategies, rather than a uniform approach.

## Recommendations

**Prioritize Movement Security in Ambush-Prone Zones**

Ambushes are the most frequent attack context (over 1,400 incidents). In South Sudan and DR Congo, where INGO exposure exceeds 50%, aid agencies should adopt GPS tracking, unpredictable routes, and pre-mission risk scans to reduce vulnerability during field operations.


**Invest in Security Infrastructure for National NGOs**

NNGOs represent 32.8% of affected workers in Afghanistan and 53.4% in Syria — yet often lack formal security support. Donors should fund field assessments, evacuation planning, and alert systems, and involve local staff in security planning to promote sustainable, context-specific protection.

**Engage Proactively with State Actors in High-Conflict Areas**

In Palestine, 63.9% of affected aid workers are from UN agencies, often caught in state-led combat. Similar patterns are seen in Syria. Agencies should maintain liaison channels with military actors and adapt visibility protocols based on local tensions.

**Customize Risk Mitigation Based on Conflict Dynamics and Agency Exposure**

INGOs, with 3,497 affected staff, face the highest risk globally. But context matters: in NSAG-dominated areas (e.g., South Sudan), discreet movement and community engagement are essential. In state-heavy environments (e.g., Syria, Palestine), legal coordination and deconfliction protocols are critical. Tailored strategies must reflect both threat dynamics and agency type to ensure effective and safe operations.
