## A Global View of Threats to Aid Workers

In crisis zones around the world — from natural disasters to active conflicts — humanitarian workers serve on the front lines of aid delivery. But increasingly, they are also on the front lines of danger.

What were once isolated events have gradually turned into more widespread patterns of violence. From Africa to the Middle East and South Asia, incidents involving aid workers have emerged across a growing number of countries. These events are not random — they reflect complex dynamics on the ground, influenced by political, social, and security factors.

This global overview offers a starting point. In the sections that follow, we’ll take a closer look at where and how these incidents have unfolded over the years, which groups have been affected the most, and how the nature of these threats has evolved.

## Escalating Danger: Aid Worker Attacks Since 1997

This line chart shows how the total number of aid workers affected — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped — has changed year over year. This timeline reveals a clear trend: attacks on humanitarian workers have surged over the past two decades. From just over 50 reported incidents in the late 1990s, the numbers have climbed dramatically, peaking above 400 in multiple recent years.

<iframe src="../plots/total_affected_over_time.html" width="800" height="500" style="flex: 0 0 auto; border: none;"></iframe>


Spikes in the data often correlate with major geopolitical crises — such as the wars in Afghanistan, the rise of conflict in South Sudan and Syria, and more recently, the escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The general trend points to an important shift: operating in conflict zones has become steadily more challenging for humanitarian workers.

## Changing Risk Exposure: Who Gets Targeted?


This bump chart reveals how the burden of violence has shifted across different types of humanitarian agencies from, ranked by their — including those killed, wounded, or kidnapped.


<iframe src="../plots/bumpchart_totalaffected_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

International NGOs (INGOs) consistently top the chart with 3,497 affected workers, reflecting their widespread presence in high-risk areas. National NGOs (NNGOs) follow with 2,055 affected, often operating in frontline roles with limited protection.

UN agencies, though heavily resourced and coordinated, are not immune: 1,775 workers have been impacted, especially in post-2000 conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were seen as representatives of international political agendas.

The Red Cross movement (split into NRCS and IFRC – 521 and ICRC – 204) generally operates under a protection mandate and neutral stance. Their lower totals may reflect more secure access or different operational strategies, but they remain at risk, particularly in civil war zones.

Finally, ‘Other’ organizations, including faith-based or smaller civil society groups, account for 105 affected workers — a lower figure, but still significant in the context of under-reported violence in some regions.

The data reveals how visibility, operational scope, and perceived affiliations influence risk. The stark gap between INGOs and others isn’t just about size — it reflects how different organizations are positioned in the geopolitical landscape of humanitarian aid.


## Who is Behind the Violence?

Understanding the actors behind attacks on aid workers is crucial to navigating humanitarian access and security.


<iframe src="../plots/piechart_actorgroups.html" width="70%" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

Nearly 48.3% of incidents involve unknown actors, reflecting the chaotic conditions of collapsed states or areas where reporting and accountability are weak.

Non-State Armed Groups are behind 30.9% of attacks — often in places like Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, and DR Congo. Their motivations range from political opposition to territorial control, viewing aid as interference or leverage.

State Actors are responsible for 13% of incidents, often during military operations or in politically sensitive contexts like Gaza and Myanmar.

Individual perpetrators (5.5%) and criminal groups (2.3%) contribute to more opportunistic violence, especially in urban zones or insecure transit corridors.

These patterns highlight the need for tailored security strategies, grounded in local political understanding and real-time threat assessments.


## How Attack Tactics Vary by Perpetrator

Different types of attackers tend to use different methods. This section explores how attack contexts — such as ambushes, raids, or detentions — vary depending on the actor group involved. Understanding these patterns helps tailor security strategies to specific threats on the ground.

## What Risks Do Different Agencies Face?

<iframe src="../plots/heatmap_attackcontext_agency.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>

This heatmap highlights how different humanitarian agency types experience distinct patterns of violence. INGOs stand out as the most frequently targeted, particularly in ambushes and individual attacks, likely due to their broad field presence and frequent travel in high-risk regions.

The United Nations follows closely, ambushes, individual and combat/crossfire incidents. Their prominent presence in conflict-heavy zones like South Sudan, Syria, and Afghanistan likely contributes to their high visibility and vulnerability.

NNGOs, often deeply embedded in local communities, are heavily affected in crossfire, underscoring the risks faced by local staff operating without the same security protocols or diplomatic protections available to international agencies.

ICRC and Red Cross affiliates (NRCS and IFRC) face fewer total incidents, but their risks are concentrated in volatile settings like ambushes — particularly during evacuations or frontline missions.

Notably, around 20% of attacks occur in unknown contexts, pointing to significant gaps in reporting and documentation. This lack of clarity can hinder security planning and limit agencies' ability to adapt effectively to emerging threats.

## Where Aid Work Is Most Dangerous

<iframe src="../plots/grp_context_top7/total_affected_7.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;"></iframe>


This chart shows the seven countries with the highest number of aid workers affected since 1997 — a reflection of long-running conflicts and operational challenges.

Afghanistan leads, with over 1,350 incidents, driven by insurgent activity, political instability, and targeted attacks. South Sudan and Sudan follow, where aid access is often contested amid civil war and intercommunal violence.

Syria, Somalia, and Palestine face continued risks tied to armed groups, military operations, and urban warfare. In the DR Congo, overlapping militia activity and weak infrastructure heighten exposure.

## Conclusions

Violence against humanitarian workers has increased notably since the early 2000s, with spikes aligning with major conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria, and South Sudan. The majority of known attacks are attributed to Non-State Armed Groups, primarily through ambushes, raids, and individual attacks in high-risk zones.

INGOs bear the highest overall burden (3,497 affected), while NNGOs face heightened risks in countries like Syria (53.4%) and Afghanistan (32.8%), often without adequate security infrastructure.

Threat patterns vary by region — State Actors are dominant in Palestine and Syria, while NSAGs lead in Somalia, Sudan, and DR Congo. This variation underscores the need for tailored, context-specific security strategies, rather than a uniform approach.

## Recommendations

**Prioritize Movement Security in Ambush-Prone Zones**

Ambushes account for over 1,400 incidents, making them the most frequent attack context across all actor groups. Countries like South Sudan (50% INGO exposure) and DR Congo (58% INGO exposure) show how road-based aid operations are especially vulnerable. Agencies should implement GPS tracking, route unpredictability, and local area scanning protocols before deployment.


**Invest in Security Infrastructure for National NGOs**

National NGOs (NNGOs) account for 32.8% of affected aid workers in Afghanistan and a staggering 53.4% in Syria, yet they often operate with fewer security resources than international counterparts. To bridge this gap, international agencies and donors should allocate dedicated security funding, covering essentials such as field risk assessments, evacuation planning, and real-time alert systems. Joint security planning that includes local staff not only ensures operational sustainability but also empowers NNGOs with equitable protection strategies tailored to the contexts they serve.

**Engage Proactively with State Actors in High-Conflict Areas**

In Palestine, 63.9% of incidents affected UN personnel, mostly due to combat and crossfire involving State Actors. Similar patterns appear in Syria, where State-linked forces are responsible for over half the attacks. Agencies operating in such environments should establish liaison offices for real-time coordination with military and police units. Visibility protocols — such as removing high-visibility logos during volatile events — should be adapted based on the threat profile.


**Customize Risk Mitigation Based on Conflict Dynamics and Agency Exposure**

With 3,497 affected staff, INGOs face the highest burden globally, particularly in Sudan (49.9%) and Somalia (34.7%). However, a one-size-fits-all approach to security is no longer viable. Agencies must tailor risk mitigation based on both who they are and who they’re operating among. In areas dominated by Non-State Armed Groups—like South Sudan or DR Congo—tactics such as unpredictable routing, discreet travel, and community-based negotiation become essential. In contrast, in contexts with high State Actor involvement—such as Syria or Palestine—agencies must emphasize legal coordination, formal deconfliction processes, and staff training on detention protocols. INGOs should institutionalize tools like real-time route tracking and vetted transport networks, while UN agencies, particularly where their exposure exceeds 25% (e.g., Palestine and Somalia), must prioritize direct coordination with peacekeeping forces and local military command structures. By aligning operational strategy with the nature of the threat, agencies can reduce vulnerability while preserving access.
